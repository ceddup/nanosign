# nanosign

[![license][license-img]][github]

A simple way to make a 'NANO ACCEPTED HERE' sign with a QRCode.

It's built on the great [kjua](https://larsjung.de/kjua/) QRCode generator and based on the the Official/Unofficial media kit from [/u/theaaronp](https://www.reddit.com/u/theaaronp)

You can customize it quite easily with the commands on the sides of the page.

Right click to save a png file and print it.

Feel free to fork, make PRs or feature requests, just hit 'Issues'.

**Please do send me the signs you make up with this tool so I can display it here as a gallery! -> Just make a ticket with your sign attached or PM me on Github or reddit.**
